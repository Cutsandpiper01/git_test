Kalen Weekend Project 1

Project: Google Homepage: Goal recreate the google homescreen in html and css
 - Centering things is not easy
 - Could focus more on exact color and link padding but I don't feel like messing with that for another hour
 -Functional!

 Project: Rock Paper Scissors: Goal create a console based Rock Paper Scissors
 - Pretty straigt forward I decided to do a strange thing with converting to numbers to lower readability but make computer side easier
 -I should add something that translates it back to tell computer score but that sounds like more work than it is worth
 - Two energy drinks down many to go. CODE WEEKEND!
 - UI is now added to rock paper scissors. same story of could do some more modifications to looks but that is a future problem
 - I really should show what the computer gets, makes the game alot more fun
