Kalen Weekend Project 1

Project: Google Homepage: Goal recreate the google homescreen in html and css
 - Centering things is not easy
 - Could focus more on exact color and link padding but I don't feel like messing with that for another hour
 -Functional!

 Project: Rock Paper Scissors: Goal create a console based Rock Paper Scissors
 - Pretty straigt forward I decided to do a strange thing with converting to numbers to lower readability but make computer side easier
 -I should add something that translates it back to tell computer score but that sounds like more work than it is worth
 - Two energy drinks down many to go. CODE WEEKEND!
 - UI is now added to rock paper scissors. same story of could do some more modifications to looks but that is a future problem
 - I really should show what the computer gets, makes the game alot more fun

 Project: Etch-a-Sketch: Goal create a dynamic grid that will be colored with mouse movement.
 - Fun project, coolest one yet no doubt
 - I should have used my functions a bit better earlier, kinda shot myself in the foot
 - TIL that one style will overwrite the other, 30 minutes of my life I won't get back
 - Neat!

 Project: Calculator: Goal create a calculator that can do basic math
 - Bit messy, I should really redesign how I did the number logging, although I have doubts about how I actually want to do that
 - I am addicted to this color scheme, Graphic design is my passion
 - Could add a bunch of if statements to make the output and it would be pretty scalable, turns out 10 hours of coding straight start to fall apart with logic
 -Update on this project, math has been refined and redesign of UI
 -Functions are much cleaner now as well compared

 Project Library: Goal create an object based library to store book information
 - I ignored the lesson and added a shelf feature I thought was cool
 - Still have alot of work to do to meet the goals, need to think on how to do zoom in and data storage
 - I think I have a decent framework in place this time suprisingly
